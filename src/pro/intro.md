# Pro Features

While much of Geo Engine's functionality is Open Source and freely usable, some parts are only available in the Pro version.
To use the Pro version, you need to purchase a Pro license.
You may, however, be eligible for a free academic license.
Please contact us at [info@geoengine.de](mailto:info@geoengine.de?subject=Academic%20License) to request one.
